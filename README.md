This is my Capstone project for SavvyCoders. 
The definition of my project is a Music/Artist networking web application geared to connect with one another in your local area & display ones work. A savvy layout designed for smooth, easy navigation making the user flow worth wild. With this web application, it will be awing artistic creations & talent from digital art, paintings, music & more. Even want to catch talent live & in person, note that this application comes with events throughout each month. Notice someone's work that you want to connect with, know that you can shoot them a message & schedule a meetup. Cool right? Making collaborations that much easier in your local area.
The content of my project will consist of tons of artistry such as; music catalogs, custom paintings, digital art & events that are happening in your local area. This will just give in a insight of all the talent in your area that you're unaware of. Also, giving you a chance to find new talent to link or collabate with in the near future. Doing so the user flow will be very simple giving the user a smooth but effecient navigation the throughout the web application. There will be a chat messenger allowing the user to communicate with any artist to schedule meetups for future collabarations. This will all be done through HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
